# png2mks

The program allows you to convert thumbnails generated by PrusaSlicer, Superslicer and Cura to a format acceptable by Elegoo Neptune 2 3D printers.

Note:<br>
Slicer must generate two thumbnails, format: PNG, size 100x100 and 200x200 px.

The program can be used as a filter inside the slicer, or as a standalone program.<br>
In addition to the file name, it accepts two other  parameters:<br>
  --keep - keep the temporary file<br>
  --log - save any errors to the log file<br>
  
Note: will not work with Neptune 3 & later (different thumbnail format)
